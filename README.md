# python_png_decoder
This is my PNG file decoder written in python3 . Largely based on this: https://pyokagan.name/blog/2019-10-14-png/ . You can follow my attempt to program this here: https://personnumber3377.github.io/projects/implementing_a_png_decoder (my personal blog) .

## TODO:

 * Support other image formats.
 * Add test cases and unit tests.
